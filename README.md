# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing_Price_Prediction

**Business use case:**

The business use case of your project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the monthly closing prices of Yes Bank stock, considering the impact of the Rana Kapoor fraud case. This model can be used by investors and stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the stock.

**Potential Impact:**

The potential impact of your project is to enhance the decision-making process for investors and stakeholders interested in Yes Bank. By accurately predicting stock prices, your project can assist them in maximizing returns and managing risks effectively. Additionally, it can contribute to a better understanding of the influence of external factors, such as the Rana Kapoor fraud case, on stock prices.

**Approach to the Problem Statement:**

Dataset Explanation: I am  using the "data_YesBank_StockPrices.csv" dataset, which contains monthly stock price information, including opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices.

Feature Engineering:  Performed feature engineering by applying the log10 transformation to the price variables to improve the distribution. Outliers are identified and removed using boxplots.

Algorithms:  I use  three regression algorithms (Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and Elastic Net) to predict stock prices. I also mentioned that cross-validation is used to estimate model performance.

 
**Challenges:**

Choosing the right features for the models: It can be difficult to determine which features are most important for predicting stock prices.
Training and evaluating the models: It can be time-consuming to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.


**Future Scope:**

Expanding the dataset to include more recent data if available to improve prediction accuracy.

Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms or time series models to assess if they provide better predictions.

Incorporating external factors and news sentiment analysis to capture the impact of events like the Rana Kapoor fraud case more accurately.

Developing a user-friendly interface or API where investors and stakeholders can access real-time predictions and insights.
